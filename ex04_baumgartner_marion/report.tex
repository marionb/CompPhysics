The plot in figure bla1 and bla2 show the mass $M(R)$ (number of sites in the percolating cluster). $R$ is the length of the square box for which $M(R)$ is calculated. The plot is shown on a loglog scale. Also shown is the fitted linear function used to determine the slope of $M(R)$. The slip of the fitted linear function gives the fractal dimension which is about $m=0.35$ for the cluster where the total lattice size is $N=100$ and $m=0.36$ for $N=50$.
For every time the Program is run different fractal dimensions are calculated. However they vary only little form what is given above (maybe $\pm .1$).
In figures bla3 and bla4 the lattice used to calculate $M(R)$ are shown.
