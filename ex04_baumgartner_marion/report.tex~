The plot in figure bla1 and bla2 show the mass $M(R)$ (number of sites in the percolating cluster). $R$ is the lenght of the suare bosx for wihch $M(R)$ is calculated. The plot is ehown on a loglog scale. Also shown is the fittet linear function used to determine the sloap of $M(R)$. The sloap of the fittet linear function gives the fractal dimension which is about $m=0.35$ for the clustre where the total latice size is $N=100$ and $m=0.36$ for $N=50$.
For every time the Program is run different fractal dimensions are clculatet. However they vary only littel form what is given above (maby $\pm .1$).
In bigures bla3 and bla4 the laticce used to calculate $M(R)$ are shown.
