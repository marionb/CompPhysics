I created three plots using different probabilities $p=0.4, 0.592, 0.8$. These probabilities were choosen in order to show that the distibution differs if we have $p<p_c$, $p\sim p_c$ and $p>p_c$. Here $p_c$ is the critical probability for the percolation system. In my results these differencec can be seen nicely in the figures \ref{sss}.
