Exercise 6, October 30, 2012 (ex06)
Ising Model


E=-J sum{S_i S_j} (1)

S_i and S_j => \pm 1 plus minuas spin

M=sum_i{s_i}

m=M/N and e=E/N


Implement simple model with Metropolis Alg. ->study equil properties


lattice as in percolation but instead of 0 and 1 we hve -1 and 1

Test posibility of changing the spin. -> consider the contribution to the energy of neighbouring spins. 

calculate \DeltaE=E_{final} -E_{init} using (1)


\Delta E<=0	=>	accept flip with prob. p=1
\Delta E>0	=>	accept flip with prob.p=exp(-\Delta E/K_B T)

Do this itterativly

Do N Montecarlo steps N=number of spins in the system


For different T (Temp) calculate average 



Plot average E v.s T and avg. magn Mv.s T

compare with critical Temperature
